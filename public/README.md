# On Track 

<sub> This web application aims to help year 12 students manage their study sessions. </sub>

## What's changed?
<sub> This web application was originally designed in Figma. The design proposal was showed to year 12 students for feedback, before it was developed into a functional prototype. </sub>

<sub> A year 12 student who was presented with my task list proposal (figure 1) provided some feedback,</sub>

> "There's just too much going on, I don't know where to look"

<sub>For this reason, in my final prototype (figure 2), I have put all the tasks information within the borders, making it easier for the user to disect the information. Instead of having an add button, the form to add a task is on the task list page, making the process of adding a task quicker.</sub>
