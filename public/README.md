# On Track 

<sub> This web application aims to help year 12 students manage their study sessions. </sub>

## What's changed?
<sub> This web application was originally designed in Figma. The design proposal was showed to year 12 students for feedback, before it was developed into a functional prototype. </sub>

## Task List

<sub> I presented a year 12 student with my proposal for my task list (figure 1) and they provided me with some feedback,</sub>

> "There's just too much going on, I don't know where to look"

<sub> With consideration to their feedback, I developed an iteration of the task list page (figure 2). I made the information easier to disect by containing all the text within the borders. Furthermore, I made the process of adding a task to the task list quicker and easier to understand by displaying the task form on the task list page (figure 2).</sub>

## Kanban Board

<br>

<sub> Before iterating the Kanban board, I considered existing kanban boards. I studied the Trello and Miro kanabn boards, as well as some kanban board's by designers on Dribble. I noticed that most of these boards used borders to distinguish between boards, which makes it easier for the user to differentiate between tasks in each board. So, for my developed prototype I have incorperated borders, improving the readability of my prototype.</sub>

<sub> I have kept the functionality of the tasks turning blue when they are put into the done column, however, I have removed the red from priority tasks as users did not understand that the red symbolised the priority rating of the tasks.</sub>

<sub> When providing feedback, a Year 12 student said that they would add and remove actual columns "very infrequently", so I have placed the add and remove buttons in the bottom right of the screen, to eliminate any hinderance on the functionality of the kanban board.</sub>

## Stopwatch

> "That's cool, but I just remember about how long it takes me, I wouldn't actually save my time"

<sub> Based on this feedback, I decided to simplify the stopwatch page and just include the actual timing feature. I extended the length of time the stopwatch can count to by including space for hours because many year 12 exams run for over an hour and students therefore need to time their practice exams for over an hour. </sub>
